Shortcut Emmet for HTML boilerplate:
•	Use ! to create the basic HTML structure: !<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
2.DOCTYPE in HTML:
•	Defines the document type as HTML: <!DOCTYPE html>
3.Void Element and Example:
•	An element that doesn't require a closing tag, often used for self-contained content.
o	Example: <br /> (line break), <hr /> (horizontal rule), <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description" /> (image)
4.Element vs. Attribute:
•	Element: The core building block of HTML, defined by opening and closing tags (e.g., <p>, <b>).
•	Attribute: Provides additional information about an element (e.g., id="main", class="heading").
5.HTML Entities:
•	Special characters escaped using &# syntax to display correctly in HTML.
o	Example: &copy; for ©, &amp; for &.
6.Meta Tags:
•	Provide information about the document that isn't displayed on the page itself, but used by browsers and search engines.
o	Examples: character encoding (<meta charset="UTF-8">), page description (<meta name="description" content="My website description">).
7.Best Way to Add Images:
•	Use the <img> element with src (source) attribute specifying the image path and alt (alternative text) for accessibility:<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
